## Supersnake

*The popular cult game snake with a modern theme, pixel look and a multiplayer.*
## Backend
*To host the server for our multiplayer application, we have chosen Render. Render provides us with the opportunity to host a NodeJS server for free for 30 days, which is sufficient for the duration of this project.*

*In the "Backend" folder, you'll find the code for the backend functionality along with an HTML dummy client. The HTML dummy client is currently no longer necessary and can be disregarded in its current state. For the execution of the server, the same backend code has been transferred to a different Git repository, which the server can access.*

## Multiplayer
*To initiate multiplayer gameplay, you should simulate two devices simultaneously in Android Studio. Once both "users" have entered their player names, the game will start. If the game doesn't start after entering the player names, it's likely because the server is in standby mode. By ending the current game and attempting again with the player name input, it should work successfully.*

## Singleplayer
*Simply click on the "Singleplayer" field to start playing the game. You can check your score in the "Score" section*  
The snake can be controlled by doing a swipe gesture into the desired direction.  
Power up (blue fields) can also be collected in order to increase growth rate of the snake for a fixed time period.

## Music
*To prevent any damage to your hearing, we advise you to reduce the volume.*
